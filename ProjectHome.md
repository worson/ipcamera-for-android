## About ##

The open source projects used in this application:

1. [Google's libjingle](http://code.google.com/apis/talk/libjingle/index.html), multiple threads, signal/slot, event loop, sockets in NDK.

2. [NanoHTTPD](http://elonen.iki.fi/code/nanohttpd/), building web server

The app support Android 2.2 and up only and your Android phone should support AMR+H.264 multimedia. It is difficult to fetch H.264 raw data from MDAT segmentation in mp4 streaming, so we only support ARM+H.264 format.

This application includes a NDK library, if your have any compile and building problems please let me know.
